This is a small collection of statistical tool I leaned in 
M248 - Analysing Data in the 2nd year of my open B.S. degree.

There are many mistakes, and the individual chapters are not 
visible in the jupyter notebook version.

Chapter 1 is a collection of techniques I found on the internet.
Chapter 2 - 6 are snippets I created myself.
